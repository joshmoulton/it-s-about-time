-- Complete fix for infinite recursion - disable RLS on admin_users entirely
-- Since admin_users is used for authentication checks, we need unrestricted access

-- Drop the recursive policy we just created
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super admins can manage admin users via email" ON public.admin_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow read access to admin users" ON public.admin_users;

-- Disable RLS entirely on admin_users to prevent any recursion
ALTER TABLE public.admin_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Alternative: If we want to keep some security, create a very simple policy
-- that doesn't reference admin_users table at all
ALTER TABLE public.admin_users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Only allow access to users who are authenticated (no table lookups)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can access admin data" 
  ON public.admin_users 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- For modifications, only allow if user is authenticated
-- (we'll handle admin checks in application logic instead of RLS)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can modify admin data" 
  ON public.admin_users 
  FOR ALL 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
